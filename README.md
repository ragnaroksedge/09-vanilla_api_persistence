## Vanilla Rest API

This is an API used to create, retrieve, and delete (POST, GET, DELETE) information about the various factions from the series Game of Thrones, called 'houses.' Each house object contains the 'name' of the family, their 'seat' of power, their home 'region', and their house 'words' or motto.

## Tests
- Tests GET and POST methods with both valid and invalid requests.
